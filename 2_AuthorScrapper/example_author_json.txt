I don't have anything specific along those lines.  But I would give the following\n\n1)  Most of the weight you will lose, you lose through diet, not exercise.  Half an hour a day of cardio will get you 300-500 calories depending on what you are doing.  A snickers bar will make most of that back up. \n\n2) The best way to make sure you have a good diet is to count calories.  Use my fitness pal or another app.  Be honest and accurate.  Know how much you are putting in your body.  I always give myself a week where I am counting calories without trying to eat healthier, and then transition into staying in my limit.  That way you can see exactly how unhealthy some of the stuff you eat can be.\n\n3) What you get from exercise is a healthier body (heart health, pulmonary health, muscle), and motivation to eat better.  \n\n4) The only way you are likely to maintain excersize is to find something you enjoy.  Try different things.  Excersize is not just sitting on a treadmill.  It can be dancing, skiiing, biking, hiking or anything that gets your heart rate up.  Aim for at least 30 min per day 5 days per week.  Try new workouts and find something you look forward to.  I love biking. I can't wait to get out and ride.  When you love it, it no longer becomes a struggle.  \n\n5) We always want to change our physical habbits.  But what you really need to change are your mental habbits.  Write down your current habbits.  Do you eat out too much?  Why?  What do you tell yourself to justify the behavior?  For me it was the side work I was doing.  I would try to eat healthy, but then go do physical side work and say 'its alright, I worked hard today'.  That was fine every once in awhile, but most of the work comes in waves.  So I would work on my eating, and then get a bunch of side work and eat out 4-5 times a week for 3 weeks.  After that I was back in the habbit of bad eating and would keep eating out for awhile until I got it back under control.  The problem wasn't the side work.  It was that I was mentally justifying eating out when I did the work.  It was one of my 'cheats'.  Figure out when you are justifying the behavior you want to change, and be aware of it.  Next, write down a list of goals you want to accomplish and why you want to accomplish them.  Hell, put the list in your wallet.  When you find yourself in a sittuation where you want to justify the bad behavior pull out the list and remind yourself of your goals.  \n\n6) Finally, make a plan and stick to it.  Plan out your meals for the week so you don't get tempted to eat out.  Plan out your excersize for the week and then don't accept excuses.  If you just say, I am going to work out 3 times this week, then you will keep pushing it off.  If you say you are going to work out MWF then you know those days you need to make it happen.  \n\nThis isn't about a quick fix or a hack.  It's about changing habits.  You don't want to lose weight and then put it back on after you are done with your diet. You want a new healthy lifestyle that you can maintain for life",

Or are you just trying to sleep with them?  Can you deal with just being their friend, and potentially watch them eventually date someone else?  If yes, when you tell them you like them and when they say they are only interested in being friends, tell them that you would want that AND here is the important part, tell them that if they ever change their mind, they have to let you know.  Then be their friend.  Don't read into shit, don't have expectations.  She wants a backrub, its a platonic backrub.  She gives you a kiss on your birthday, its a platonic kiss.  She flirts with you, she is just having some fun.  If she dates someone else, be happy for her, she is your friend.  \n\nWhy?  A couple of reasons.
